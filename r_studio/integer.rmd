```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Print 1 to 10


```{r}
print (1)
print (2)
print (3)
print (4)
print (5)
print (6)
print (7)
print (8)
print (9)
print (10)
```

## Using for..loop


```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {print (i)}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
